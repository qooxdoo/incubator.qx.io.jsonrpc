<p>This namespace contains an interface for and different implementations of
 a transport for jsonrpc data.</p>
<p>{@link qx.io.jsonrpc.transport.ITransport} specifies that a
 transport has to provide for three things:</p>
<ol>
   <li>It must have an "endpoint" property which identifies where the json-rpc peer server is located</li>
   <li>It must have a "send" method which knows how to transport the which takes an UTF-8 encoded message string
      and passes it to the endpoint, and</li>
   <li>It must fire a "message" event when it receives such a message from the peer.</li>
 </ol>
